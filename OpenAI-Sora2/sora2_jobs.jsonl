Slight gate weave and handheld micro-shake evoke vintage intimacy. Warm Kodak-inspired grade; light halation on bulbs; film grain and soft vignette for period authenticity.\n\nAt golden hour, a brick tenement rooftop transforms into a small stage. Laundry lines strung with white sheets sway in the wind, catching the last rays of sunlight. Strings of mismatched fairy bulbs hum faintly overhead. A young woman in a flowing red silk dress dances barefoot, curls glowing in the fading light. Her partner — sleeves rolled, suspenders loose — claps along, his smile wide and unguarded. Below, the city hums with car horns, subway tremors, and distant laughter.\nCinematography:\nCamera: medium-wide shot, slow dolly-in from eye level\nLens: 40 mm spherical; shallow focus to isolate the couple from skyline\nLighting: golden natural key with tungsten bounce; edge from fairy bulbs\nMood: nostalgic, tender, cinematic\n\nActions:\n- She spins; her dress flares, catching sunlight.\n- Woman (laughing): \"See? Even the city dances with us tonight.\"\n- He steps in, catches her hand, and dips her into shadow.\n- Man (smiling): \"Only because you lead.\"\n- Sheets drift across frame, briefly veiling the skyline before parting again.\n\t\nBackground Sound:\nNatural ambience only: faint wind, fabric flutter, street noise, muffled music. No added score.", "model": "sora-2", "size": "1280x720", "seconds": "4", "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/videos"}
