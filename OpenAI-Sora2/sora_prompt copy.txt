Style: 1970s romantic drama, shot on 35 mm film with natural flares, soft focus, and warm halation. Slight gate weave and handheld micro-shake evoke vintage intimacy. Warm Kodak-inspired grade; light halation on bulbs; film grain and soft vignette for period authenticity.

At golden hour, a brick tenement rooftop transforms into a small stage. Laundry lines strung with white sheets sway in the wind, catching the last rays of sunlight. Strings of mismatched fairy bulbs hum faintly overhead. A young woman in a flowing red silk dress dances barefoot, curls glowing in the fading light. Her partner — sleeves rolled, suspenders loose — claps along, his smile wide and unguarded. Below, the city hums with car horns, subway tremors, and distant laughter.
Cinematography:
Camera: medium-wide shot, slow dolly-in from eye level
Lens: 40 mm spherical; shallow focus to isolate the couple from skyline
Lighting: golden natural key with tungsten bounce; edge from fairy bulbs
Mood: nostalgic, tender, cinematic
