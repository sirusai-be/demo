A cinematic 8-second shot of a sleek chrome astronaut standing on a glowing digital launchpad shaped like neural circuits. The camera slowly orbits around the astronaut as blue and magenta lights pulse through the circuits. The astronaut raises their hand and activates a holographic AI core made of floating geometric data symbols. The holographic core transforms into a luminous data-rocket that bursts upward into the starry night sky, leaving trails of light and particles forming the words “SirusAI — From Idea to Orbit” in glowing letters across a nebula.
Style: cinematic, ultra-detailed, volumetric lighting, high contrast, smooth motion, lens flare, depth of field, glowing particles, holographic sci-fi aesthetic.
